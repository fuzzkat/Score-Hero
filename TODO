Next steps

* Identify if keypress matches nearest note to play head.
* Common timing for keypress measurement and tune position
    - Base timing on MIDI sync?
* Change tune to be more than just an array of equal length notes
    - Store tune as MIDI?
    - Could then easily write tunes for ScoreHero using MIDI sequencer
* Represent accuracy of keypress in a view
* Forward midi notes to midi output device to provide additional user feedback
